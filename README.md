# ft_ls
Recreation of the shell command "ls" and some of its options.

## Flags

The flags I have created (so far) :

```-a``` - shows all files including hidden files.

```-r``` - reverses the original "ls" output list.

```-R``` - list subdirectories recursively.

```-t``` - sorts files according to last modification time.
